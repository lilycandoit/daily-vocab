# Daily Vocab Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in three sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16) - For toolbar
- icon48.png (48x48) - For extension management page  
- icon128.png (128x128) - For Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design
- Blue gradient background (#3498db to #2980b9)
- White book symbol with "ABC" text
- Small star for daily learning
- Clean, professional design optimized for language learning

## Temporary Solution
For now, the extension will use Chrome's default icons. You can:
1. Use the icon-generator.html in this directory to generate simple icons
2. Create your own icons and place them in this directory
3. Use an online icon generator to create professional icons

## Recommended Icon Specifications
- Use a blue color scheme for consistency with the extension theme
- Include a book/language learning symbol
- Ensure good contrast at small sizes
- Test on both light and dark browser themes

## Icon Generation Tool
Open `icon-generator.html` in your browser to generate basic placeholder icons.
