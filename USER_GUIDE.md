## Tips for Best Results

1. **Don't save too many words at once** - Quality over quantity! 5-10 words per day is ideal.

2. **Use the AI export feature** - This is your secret weapon. ChatGPT can explain nuances that dictionaries miss.

3. **Focus on pronunciation** - That's what this extension is built for! Use the audio feature.

4. **Review regularly** - The 9 PM reminder helps build a habit.

5. **Context matters** - The extension saves the sentence where you found the word. Use it!

6. **Australian English focus** - If you're in Australia, use the "Australian English Usage" export template.

## Troubleshooting

**Tooltip not appearing?**
- Make sure you've reloaded the webpage after installing/updating the extension
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Tooltips are disabled on some secure Chrome system pages (like Settings or the New Tab page)

**No saved words showing?**
- Click the 💾 save button in the tooltip (double-clicking only shows the tooltip)

**Audio not playing?**
- We use a special background system to play audio on highly secure sites like Notion and ChatGPT.
- If it fails, it usually means the external dictionary doesn't have a recording for that specific word.
- The pronunciation (IPA) is always displayed in the tooltip as a fallback.

**Extension not working after update?**
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`
- Refresh all open webpages (this is required to load the new logic)

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Optional)

You can set custom keyboard shortcuts:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find "Daily Vocab"
3. Set shortcuts for:
